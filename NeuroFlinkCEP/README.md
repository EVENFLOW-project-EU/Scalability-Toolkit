# DAG*4CER Optimizer
## Version
The following runtimes and tools are required:

- **Java** 11 or 17

- **Docker Compose** (to orchestrate the optimizer, Kibana, and Elasticsearch)

## How to Use

1. From the `DAGStar4CER-optimizer` root directory, run:  
   ```bash
   mvn package
2. Start all services with Docker Compose
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
3. Once up, verify that:

* The optimizer container is running and processing workflows at http://localhost:8080

* Kibana is accessible at http://localhost:5601

# Robotic-Scenario 
## Version
- **Python** 3.7
- **TensorFlow** 1.15

## How to use 

### Training

1. Create and activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
2. Run the training script, that uses `label_encoder_goal_status` as label encoder, `scaler.pkl` as feature scaler and `smart_factory_with_collisions_100_robots-split.csv` as dataset.

> **Note:**
> - The `trained_model/` directory contains the already trained model


# Robot Dataset

### Dataset Description

The `smart_factory_with_collisions_100_robots.csv` file contains one row per robot per time step:

| Column               | Type    | Description                                                     |

| `goal_status`        | String  | Current status or event label ( `collision detected`, `stopped at station [0-9]`, stopped unknown, `moving to station [0-9]`)       |
| `idle`               | Bool    | `True` if the robot is idle                                     |
| `linear`             | Bool    | `True` if the robot is in linear motion                         |
| `rotational`         | Bool    | `True` if the robot is rotating                                 |
| `Deadlock_Bool`      | Bool    | `True` if the robot is in a deadlock condition                  |
| `RobotBodyContact`   | Bool    | `True` if the robot’s body is in contact with another object    |

# Telecom-Scenario
## Version
- **Python** 3.7
- **TensorFlow** 1.15

## How to Use

### Training
1. Create and activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the training script. The dataset uses **one-hot encoding** for categorical features (e.g., call direction, number prefixes) and **standardization** for numerical features (e.g., duration, charge amount).  
   Labels correspond to fraud-related flags:  
   - **A**: Call made to a premium location  
   - **B**: Call made during night hours  
   - **C**: Long call  



# Telecom Dataset
