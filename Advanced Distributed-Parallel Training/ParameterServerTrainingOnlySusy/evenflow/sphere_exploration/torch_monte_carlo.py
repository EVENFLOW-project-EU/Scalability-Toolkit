        We can use Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the min and max L-infinity norm values.
        By using Monte Carlo sampling, we avoid the need to create a large tensor containing all possible combinations
            of points, and we reduce the computational complexity of the problem.
        You can control the trade-off between accuracy and performance by adjusting the num_samples parameter.
        Increasing the number of samples will provide a more accurate approximation,
            but it will also require more computation time.
        Note that this implementation provides an approximate solution rather than an exact one.
        However, in high-dimensional problems like this, the approximate solution is often sufficient and
        much more computationally feasible.
